Phew! Seems we've lost one of our wedding rings… 😮 \
Luckily you have found it! 😊

So first of all, thank you! ❤️

And you probably wondered what this URL is all about. \
(Who engraves a URL on a wedding ring, right? 😄) \
Well, it's our unusual way to ensure the rings---when found---can easily be returned from anywhere in the world.

## What can you do?

1. Call us:
   [+49 174 9273954](tel:+491749273954)&nbsp;<small>(Heinrich)</small> or
   [+49 176 47728275](tel:+4917647728275)&nbsp;<small>(Lena)</small>
2. Send us a parcel:

   <address>

   Lena Merker & Jan Heinrich Reimer  
   Hohestieg 12  
   38118 Braunschweig  
   Germany

   </address>

   We'd recommend [DHL](https://dhl.com) for international shipping.

Of course, we're more than happy to reimburse any expenses you have by sending the ring back to us.

Thank you!

Lena und Heini
